      "A herb is a plant or plant part used for its scent, flavor, or therapeutic properties. Herbal medicines are one type of dietary supplement. They are sold as tablets, capsules, powders, teas, extracts, and fresh or dried plants. People use herbal medicines to try to maintain or improve their health. Many people believe that products labeled ”natural” are always safe and good for them. This is not necessarily true. Herbal medicines do not have to go through the testing that drugs do. Some herbs, such as comfrey and ephedra, can cause serious harm. Some herbs can interact with prescription or over-the-counter medicines.",

      "Acu means “needle”, puncture means “to pierce or perforate”, acupuncture is a representative non-drug intervention in Traditional Chinese Medicine based on a meridional theory, in which hair-thin needles are inserted into the body. In TCM, illness is said to be the consequences of imbalance of “Yin and Yang” of the vital energy, which better known as “Qi”. Qi flows in the pathway, known as “meridian”, connected by more than 2000 acupuncture points in human body. By inserting needles in certain acupuncture points, it improves the the flow of Qi and dynamic balance of Yin and Yang, thereby improving health. Modern researches studied that acupuncture helps to stimulate the central nervous system which in turn releases chemicals such as endorphins (natural pain killers) into muscles, spinal cord and brain. These biochemical changes stimulate the body’s natural healing abilities and promote overall physical and emotional well-being. Hundreds of clinical studies on the benefits of acupuncture show that it successfully treats condition ranging from musculoskeletal problems (neck pain, back pain, and others) to nausea, migraine headache, digestive problem, anxiety, depression, insomnia and infertility.",

      "Moxibustion is a non-invasive procedure that involves burning moxa, a cone or stick made of ground mugwort leaves on or near the skin corresponding with body’s meridians or acupuncture points. The mechanisms of moxibustion are based on two aspects: the actions of the meridian system and the roles of moxa and fire. Moxibustion has dual effect of tonification and purgation.The heat generated during moxibustion helps warming and tonifying the deficiency, as well as improving the flow of Qi and blood in meridians, purging the excess, and reactivating the meridian system. Moxibustion is used in various diseases, especially chronic conditions in “cold” patterns where symptoms feel better with the application of heat. For instance, pain due to injury or arthritis, asthma, gastrointestinal disorders, gynecological conditions, insomnia, or even weakness and fatigue.",

      "Cupping is performed by using several kinds of cups, such as bamboo, plastics or glass cup to create suction on the skin over desired acupoints, painful area, or a reflex zone, to make the local place hyperemia or haemostasis, which can obtain the purpose of curing the diseases. The main types of cupping practice including retained cupping, bleeding cupping and moving cupping. In retained cupping, only vacuum is applied by utilizing flaming or suction pump. In bleeding cupping (wet cupping), controlled medicinal bleeding is applied before suction. In moving cupping, lotion or oil is applied on the skin and gently moving the cups to cover up bigger area. Each kind of cupping therapy may be used for different diseases or different purposes of treatment. In TCM, cupping promotes the flow of Qi-blood, purges the blockage and draw the stagnant toxin out of the body. Mechanically, it helps to increase blood circulation, whereas physiologically it activates the immune system and stimulates the mechanosensitive fibers, thus leading to a relief of muscle tension or reduction in pain. Thereby, cupping is effective against the so-called syndrome of general malaise, such as stiff neck and shoulders, lowback pain, chronic headaches, dizziness, languor (mental or physical weariness),  fatigue, etc. Be concerned that cupping leaves temporary marks on the skin which would fade within 1 week times.

      "Gua sha is intended to address stagnant energy, called chi, in the body that practitioners believe may be responsible for inflammation. Inflammation is the underlying cause of several conditions associated with chronic pain. Rubbing the skin’s surface is thought to help break up this energy, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. Gua sha is generally performed on a person’s back, buttocks, neck, arms, and legs. A gentle version of it is even used on the face as a facial technique. Your technician may apply mild pressure, and gradually increase intensity to determine how much force you can handle.",
