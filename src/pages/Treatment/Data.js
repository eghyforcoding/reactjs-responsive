      "Cupping is performed by using several kinds of cups, such as bamboo, plastics or glass cup to create suction on the skin over desired acupoints, painful area, or a reflex zone, to make the local place hyperemia or haemostasis, which can obtain the purpose of curing the diseases. ",
      "The main types of cupping practice including retained cupping, bleeding cupping and moving cupping. In retained cupping, only vacuum is applied by utilizing flaming or suction pump. In bleeding cupping (wet cupping), controlled medicinal bleeding is applied before suction. In moving cupping, lotion or oil is applied on the skin and gently moving the cups to cover up bigger area. Each kind of cupping therapy may be used for different diseases or different purposes of treatment.",
      "In TCM, cupping promotes the flow of Qi-blood, purges the blockage and draw the stagnant toxin out of the body. Mechanically, it helps to increase blood circulation, whereas physiologically it activates the immune system and stimulates the mechanosensitive fibers, thus leading to a relief of muscle tension or reduction in pain. Thereby, cupping is effective against the so-called syndrome of general malaise, such as stiff neck and shoulders, lowback pain, chronic headaches, dizziness, languor (mental or physical weariness),  fatigue, etc. Be concerned that cupping leaves temporary marks on the skin which would fade within 1 week times.
